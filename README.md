WeatherApplication
==================

A java application that web scraps information from http://www.accuweather.com to display weather for any US City. It takes the hourly temperatures and hourly humidity/rain/snow/ice percentages and displays it in graph form for up to 4 days in advanced. Possible to easily modify it so that it could do more than 4 days if that information was readily available.
